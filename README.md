# Welcome to my profile :sunny:
 ðŸ‘‹ Hi stranger, Iâ€™m @IlyaBerzhanin and I'm Frontend Developer  
 
 :ghost: Before you sink into my projects I should say that:
 1. **Every project** has its own current **status** in readme file => because some of them some can be unfinished at this moment 
 2. I realize that some projects(even with _completed_ status) can contain code issues and I'd better refactor it, thank you!
 
 :pray: I hope you will be satisfied or at least not disappointed with my repositories
